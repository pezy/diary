## Plan of scanning about WebGL JavaScript Libraries.

- Google O3D ([repo](https://code.google.com/p/o3d/))

Google's O3D library was once a browser plug-in but has now been released as a standalone JavaScript library for WebGL. 
The examples of using O3D with JavaScript -- including a fairly spectacular 3D pool game -- are very impressive. 
O3D allows you to load COLLADA 3D models created with Google SketchUp( as well as other 3D packages).

**The required code looks about as complex as straight WebGL code**, so while this is very powerful, 
you might want to look at some of the other libraries here first if you are just starting out.

- GLGE ([index](http://www.glge.org/) | [repo](https://github.com/supereggbert/GLGE))

"WebGL for the lazy" is the tagline for this JavaScript library. The author of the library, Paul Brunt, says this about GLGE:

> The aim of GLGE is so mask the involved nature of WebGL from the web developer, who can then spend his/her time creating richer content for the Web.

This is a high-level API that is still in development. Just like O3D, it has the ability to load COLLADA models. 
Applications written with GLGE are created with a combination of XML and JavaScript. It looks very promising.

- C3DL ([repo](https://github.com/cathyatseneca/c3dl))

The tagline for C3DL is "WebGL made easy!" C3DL, or "Canvas 3D JS Library", is similar to GLGE, 
but it seems to have a head start thanks to a larger API and more support. This library also appears to be slanted toward games, 
as a realtime strategy(RTS) and an arcade game are featured as its more prominent demos. The library supports COLLADA models, 
and the code also appears very straightforward to implement.

- SpiderGL ([index](http://spidergl.org/) | [repo](https://github.com/dibenedetto/SpiderGL))

"3D Graphics for Next-Generation WWW" is how SpiderGL bills itself to the world.
This library appears to be very similar to GLGE and C3DL, except that the demos focus
more on lighting, color, and textures than on games and applications. It also supports COLLADA models.

- SceneJS ([index](http://scenejs.org/) | [repo](https://github.com/xeolabs/scenejs))

SceneJS is geared toward rendering 3D scenes built as COLLADA JSON models in
WebGL. You can also define and manipulate 3D scenes. Loading and rendering the
models is a straightforward process, and the results are quite impressive.

- CopperLicht ([index](http://www.ambiera.com/copperlicht/) | [repo](https://github.com/Sebmaster/copperlicht))

This commercial library advertises itself as the "fast WebGL JavaScript 3D Engine." All the demos are game-oriented, 
and the library supports many commercial 3D formats. It has both collision detection and physics built in. 
The demos are fast and are fun to play. This library appears to be centered on loading and using external 3D assets, 
so if that is what you are looking for, this might be your best choice.

- Three.js ([index](http://threejs.org/) | [repo](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/))

The most promising WebGL library might be three.js. It's a free, lightweight API that is
gaining popularity because it is easy to use and implement.
