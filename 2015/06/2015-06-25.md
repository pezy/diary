Only A little puzzled: How to understand `invariant` and `precise` qualifier meaning?

> - `invariant`: It will guarantee that if two shader invocations each set the output variable with the **same expression**
> and the **same values for the variables** in that expression, then both will **compute the same value**.

why it need guarantee? same expression, and same values for the variables in that expression. Of course that are the same value.

Maybe it is about floating-point precision.

> - `precise`: Generally, you use `precise` instead of `invariant` when you need to get the same result from an expression,
> even if values feeding the expression are **permuted in a way** that should not mathematically affect the result.

Example:

```
Location = a * b + c * d;
```

It should get the same result if the value of `a` and `b` are exchanged. Likewise, if the value of `c` and `d` are exchanged.

What is the different? `invariant` guarantee for the same expression, but `precise` shouldn't ask for same expression, it can be 
different after permuted in a way.

## Python

Q: How to use `C/C++` in python? 

A: You should use [`ctypes`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/ctypes.html) to do that.

`ctypes` can load `.dll`s or `.so`s which are written by `C/C++`.
