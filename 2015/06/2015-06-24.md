## C++

### [Why is the size of an empty class not zero?](http://www.stroustrup.com/bs_faq2.html#sizeof-empty)

Simply say, to ensure that the addresses of two different objects will be different.

Thus, 

```cpp
class Empty{ };

Empty empty;
std::cout << sizeof(empty) << std::endl; // should be 1.
```
