Compare the type of foreign key and current field. Maybe it was `INT UNSIGNED` in one table, and it was `INT` in referencing table.

### [Error number 121](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4412693/sql-error-code-1005-with-error-number-121)

It comes when your foreign key name **already exits in the database.**
