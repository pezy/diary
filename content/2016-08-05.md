## OpenSceneGraph's line smooth.

`GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH` display diagonal lines:

try to set:
```c
glBlendFunc(SRC_ALPHA, ONE);
glEnable(GL_BLEND)
glDisable(GL_DEPTH_TEST)
```

`GL_POLYGON_SMOOTH` is a bad solution to solve anti aliasing problem.
The setting of yesterday given is come from the red-book: Antialiasing Polygons.

A better idea is to use `MSAA`, which have a great introduction on [here](http://learnopengl.com/#!Advanced-OpenGL/Anti-Aliasing).

In OSG, we only need one line code:
`osg::DisplaySettings::instance()->setNumMultiSamples(4);`

But, It should be noted that you should set multisamples in Qt if you use OSG with Qt(QOpenGLWidget). like following:
```cpp
QSurfaceFormat format;
format.setSamples(4);
this->setFormat(format);
```

Put it in construction of the class which is inheritd from `QOpenGLWidget`.
