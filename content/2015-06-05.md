## [C++] Start to use `static_assert` replace a part of `assert`
 
C's `assert` is very useful tool for caching invalid invariants. But a big problem with `assert` is that it's a **run-time** check, 
and when we release our program, `assert` would be no effect.

Fortunately, A compile-time assert mechanism was added: `static_assert`.

`static_assert` acts like run-time `assert` except that checked-condition must be a [constant-expression](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/constant_expression).

We can use it judge compiler word size:

```cpp
int main()
{
    auto i = 0;
    auto *pI = &i;
    static_assert(sizeof(pI) == 4, "This is 32-bits Compiler.");
}
```

and [library version](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1647913/1155235):

```cpp
#include "SomeLibrary.h"

static_assert(SomeLibrary::Vertion > 2, "Old versions of SomeLibrary are missing the foo functionality. Cannot proceed!");
```

More [example](https://blog.feabhas.com/2015/06/bitesize-modern-c-static_assert/):

```cpp
constexpr int calc(const int i) {
    return i * sizeof(int);
}

int main() {
    constexpr int sz = calc(20);
    static_assert(sz < 10, "Array size is too big.");
    
    // ...
    
    double array[sz]; // we know we're ok there.
}
```
