## OpenGL Shader

I decide to read the opengl-redbook, and build it's demo according to engineer's way.

Thus, I new a repository that named [`ShaderGUI`](https://github.com/pezy/ShaderGUI). The name of the repository may not be suitable.

It just a Shader View that based on Qt's `QOpenGLWidget`, rather than create a GUI framework by shader.

Today, I use all the time to do this.
